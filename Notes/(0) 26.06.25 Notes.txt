Each game is held in an anchor element with each anchor element being children
of the divider with an id of "search_resultsRows". 
Each anchor element has classname of "search_result_row ds_collapse_flag_
app_impression_tracked" (Needs investigating though because when I loaded the
page before, the app_impression_tracked part was not in the classname????)

Each anchor element also has a child span element which holds the title of the
video game. So, I use that to display in the console what the next game is.
(Idea: Have a custom print function that can be supressed if debug is false or
something like that)

Going to investigate this further.

Adding the app_tracked part to the anchor classname search returns nothing.
Odd.

09:49: Okay, so the scraping program can find the anchor elements needed to
open video game pages later and can also find the span elements that hold the
titles. However, I've already ran into the problem I was worried about:
Infinite scrolling. On the all games page as it is now, the last game is
"Planet Zoo". When in a browser, the user would just simply scroll down to
this game and the page would load more. However, requests is static and only
calls the page once. Research time...
