Each game is held in an anchor element with each anchor element being children
of the divider with an id of "search_resultsRows". 
Each anchor element has classname of "search_result_row ds_collapse_flag_
app_impression_tracked" (Needs investigating though because when I loaded the
page before, the app_impression_tracked part was not in the classname????)

Each anchor element also has a child span element which holds the title of the
video game. So, I use that to display in the console what the next game is.
(Idea: Have a custom print function that can be supressed if debug is false or
something like that)

Going to investigate this further.
