9:43: I have finished anaylsing the data. Excel was a complete pain to work
with, but I got the job done. I analysed the data in two ways:
-1: Through pivot tables which allowed me to analyse the price per year, per
month and per day and also the number of games per year.
-2: Through additional tables which involved splitting the tags, genres,
developers and publishers from Python lists into multiple rows. This was the
part where Excel started to not behave, but, luckily, Notepad++ had my back
with its search and replace tool to remove the bracks and commas. Funny
though, I am praising Notepad++ while writing this in Vim, lol.

Anyway, my next plan of action, before writing the report which I still have
yet to do -_-, is to write a program that splits those Python lists into
additional collumns for me. This will help later on I think.
