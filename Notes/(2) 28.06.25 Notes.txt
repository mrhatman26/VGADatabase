9:12: Technically a day off, but that encoding issue was really bugging me
since the program worked fine apart from that. But, I fixed it by changing
UTF-8 encoding on the CSV writer to UTF-8-SIG which according to a
Stackoverflow comment puts the BOM in the meta data rather than inside the
document. Excel sees the BOM in the metadata and understands that the file is
UTF-8 and not something else. Don't trust Excel to handle bomb defusal or
however that joke went in my head.

9:35: Forgot to mention I am doing a massive test of the program. I'm having
it do ten thousand (10, 000) games. I wonder what errors will occur?

10:32: Okay, so it took well over an hour, but collecting 10 thousand games
apparently worked just fine... I am quite surprised there wasn't an error
honestly... My next thing will be to at least try and get the supported
languages part. Though that looks like it will be quite complicated.

19:53: After nearly 3 hours, I have finally got the program to get the
supported languages. Except, I made it so that it got exactly how the game
implements that language. Why? I really don't know. I am going to see how much
this slows the program down and, if it is significant enough, I will change th
code to ONLY get the languages, not how they are implemented. It'd be cool to
keep that though.
