9:49: Was going to start writing about the scraping program, but then I
noticed something. I'm missing a clarifier that determines what it is that's
being scraped. That is, I completely forgot that Steam doesn't just games, but
hardware and software as well (and game bundles too). So, the data needs to
account for that. I have an idea as to how this might be achieved, but first,
I need a shower.

11:56: I implemented the idea I had and it, surprisingly, works. Going to do
the big ten thousand test for this, but, due to how long that will take, I
won't be around to supervise it in case anything goes wrong because I'll be at
work. I expect to get back and see an exception error of some sort. Either
that or strangley missing data that wasn't missing before or I didn't notice
it before. So work will be fun...

21:41: Too warm to do anything else after work... But the program worked. I
will leave the scraping here now and focus on data analysis and also writing
about the scraping program... I just hope the heat goes away... -_-
