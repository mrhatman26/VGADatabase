He wondered if there was a way to eliminate that, make a shoe that would lace automatically to adjust to your foot specifically. That is when he started working on a self-lacing technology that was later on named, E.A.R.L. (Electro Adaptive Reactive Lacing). When the technology was developed, they were originally going to release it first on a basketball shoe. However, Tinker Hatfield ended up putting it in the Nike Mag to fulfill the public's wish.[11] Then on October 21, 2015, which is the same date Marty McFly visited the future in Back to the Future Part II, Nike unveiled a self-lacing version of the Nike Mag which was scheduled to go on sale March 20, 2016.[12] The release was delayed to October 4, 2016. Michael J. Fox was the first to get Nike shoes in October 2015.[13] On October 4, 2016, Nike opened a raffle for the Nike Mag through the RallyUp fundraising platform, where anyone could purchase a ticket for $10 (unlimited entries), but the raffle was limited to 89 pairs.[14] All proceeds would be donated to Parkinson's research.

That is, those circuits that depend on the previous output(s) of the circuit as well as its current external inputs. Such circuits can be represented by a state machine. It is sometimes possible that some states that are nominally can't-happen conditions can accidentally be generated during power-up of the circuit or else by random interference (like cosmic radiation, electrical noise or heat). This is also called forbidden input.[21] In some cases, there is no combination of inputs that can exit the state machine into a normal operational state. The machine remains stuck in the power-up state or can be moved only between other can't-happen states in a walled garden of states. This is also called a hardware lockup or soft error. Such states, while nominally can't-happen, are not don't-care, and designers take steps either to ensure that they are really made can't-happen, or else if they do happen, that they create a don't-care alarm indicating an emergency state[21] for error detection, or they are transitory and lead to a normal operational state.[22][23][24]"

Carnes, who was 19, was spared the death penalty after some custodial officers who had been taken hostage testified that he had refrained from following instructions from Cretzer to kill them, but also due to the strong defense of his lawyer, Archer Zamloch. Although Sam Shockley's lawyer, W. A. Sullivan, pleaded insanity, Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson both received death sentences, to the great disbelief of their lawyers and even the prosecuting U.S. attorney, Hennessy. President Truman, a good friend of Warden Johnston, denied the bid for clemency. Shockley accepted his fate and rejected any further efforts to stay the execution. He and Thompson were executed simultaneously in the San Quentin gas chamber on December 3, 1948. Sam Shockley is buried at Pollard cemetery in Haworth, Oklahoma.[2]"

Lloviu virus,"['(Top)', 'Use of term', 'Species inclusion criteria', 'History', 'Virology\nToggle Virology subsection\nGenome\nReplication', 'Genome', 'Replication', 'References', 'External links']","The LLOV life cycle is hypothesized to begin with virion attachment to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by internalization, fusion of the virion envelope with endosomal membranes and the concomitant release of the virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. LLOV glycoprotein (GP) is cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsins) and the cleaved glycoprotein interacts with the intracellular entry receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1).[10] The virus RdRp would partially uncoat the nucleocapsid and transcribe the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which would then be translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. LLOV L would bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription would either terminate after a gene or continue to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome would be transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end would be least likely to be transcribed. The gene order would therefore be a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced would be the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell would determine when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication would result in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that would in turn be transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes would self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions would bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles would then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.[9]"

Strong gives Michael a mission: one that, if it succeeds, will secure freedom for all of them for good, but will send them all back to prison if it fails. The mission is to take down the operation headed by a man named Randall Burke, whom Strong calls an international terrorist. Burke's operation has consumed Strong for the last eight years, and though he knows some of Burke's deeds, Strong says he's never been able to get anyone close enough to take Burke down. Michael goes deep undercover to get hired by Burke, but soon finds out that Burke is really more of an operative, and is working for someone much more powerful. Strong reluctantly allows Michael to bring back Sam and Jesse for assistance on his mission, then Strong himself blackmails Fiona into helping. When Michael reveals to Strong that Burke has bosses, and Burke later dies, Strong insists that Michael's mission is not over and that he must now take down Burke's leaders. Strong sanctions a number of questionable moves after Michael gets deep into James' organization—including the assassination of a go-between that Michael once worked with and considered to be a friend. (Strong convinces Michael that the go-between had caused more ""good guys"" to be killed than Michael would ever know about.) After Michael frees James and Sonya and is thought to be dead, he contacts Strong and convinces him that his cover is still intact. Then Strong and Michael convince the CIA Director to give them 48 more hours to capture James. But the capture goes bad when Michael kills Sonya, resulting in James fleeing by helicopter, and Strong alerts authorities that Michael, Sam, Jesse and Fiona are now wanted criminals. However, after Michael and Fiona ""die"" in the explosion of James' satellite uplink facility, and information leads to the capture of over 100 of James' operatives, Strong finds a way to keep Sam and Jesse out of prison. He also arranges for Michael to get a star on the CIA Memorial Wall."

That is, those circuits that depend on the previous output(s) of the circuit as well as its current external inputs. Such circuits can be represented by a state machine. It is sometimes possible that some states that are nominally can't-happen conditions can accidentally be generated during power-up of the circuit or else by random interference (like cosmic radiation, electrical noise or heat). This is also called forbidden input.[21] In some cases, there is no combination of inputs that can exit the state machine into a normal operational state. The machine remains stuck in the power-up state or can be moved only between other can't-happen states in a walled garden of states. This is also called a hardware lockup or soft error. Such states, while nominally can't-happen, are not don't-care, and designers take steps either to ensure that they are really made can't-happen, or else if they do happen, that they create a don't-care alarm indicating an emergency state[21] for error detection, or they are transitory and lead to a normal operational state.[22][23][24]"

In addition, NBO analysis showed that the charge on the galliums within the (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)gallium(I) ligands were much higher than the charge on the Au atoms and the charge on the gallium atoms within the GaI2 motifs.

The speech has been quoted at Black Lives Matter Movements, and secondhand sources say it was referenced at the University of Virginia march.

The core game includes Harry, Murphy, Susan, Michael, and the Alphas and plays through the first five novels as well as Side Jobs, a random scenario generator based on the short story collection of the same name.[36] The art for the game is not screen grabs from the TV show, but is instead original artwork by Fred Hicks, Chris McGrath, and Tyler Walpole.[38] The game was fairly well received, with a rating of 7.2 out of 10 on Board Game Geek's site.[39] The rating system is based on user ratings, with a minimum number of votes required,[40] and is subject to change, although drastic change is uncommon. Three expansions for this game were released along with the base game in 2017, and two more were released the following year.[41]"

Unlike Illustris, it was run on the Hazel Hen machine at the High Performance Computing Center, Stuttgart in Germany. Up to 25,000 computer cores were employed. In December 2018 the simulation data from IllustrisTNG was released publicly. The data service includes a JupyterLab interface.

They argued it should be taught alongside science, but not within the science curriculum itself.[26][27] Efforts to include it in education were criticized on the grounds that it is inseparable from spiritual and religious beliefs, leading to their introduction into science classes; that it is not possible to reconcile contradictions between the two; that it comes at the cost of delivering curricula that meets international standards; that policies granting science and indigenous knowledge equal status are based on relativism and inhibit science from questioning claims made by indigenous knowledge systems; and that many proponents of indigenous knowledge engage in ideological antiscience rhetoric.[28] The vitalist Māori concept of mauri was inserted into the New Zealand national chemistry curriculum, and the government ignored the objections of science teachers citing the 'equal status' (mana ōrite) policy.

Some ‘newly escaped’ organisms were previously unknown to science before they escaped[44] and current international standards for pest risk analysis cannot assess risks from unknown organisms. In addition, a pest risk analysis will focus on a pest at the species level assuming the pest to be genetically stable but this can be a great oversimplification if the pest has a short generation time with capacity for rapid genetic change.[45] During the assessment of impact, assessors focus on impacts on known hosts or habitats. However, if a pest adapts to a new host plant[46][47] or habitat once established in the pest risk analysis area, impacts will be underestimated. Risk analyses for invasive species have also been criticised for being narrowly focused, subjective, often arbitrary and unquantified, and subject to political interference."

Je t'aime No. IV,"['(Top)', 'Description', 'References']","In this painting there is a definite focus on large areas of bold color. There is hardly any mixing of colors except for a little red/white, blue/white, and black/white. In the background there are large blocks of canvas painted with the warm colors red, tan, yellow, and orange. On top of that there are random areas covered with blue, red, and tan. On top of that are the colors, white, yellow, and tan. The only piece of this painting that appears to represent any kind of form is the word “Je t'aime”, which is French for “I love you.” These drastic color differences go along with Motherwell’s “push and pull” concept that all movement within a painting necessarily implies a reciprocal movement in the opposing direction. Many people have suspected that Motherwell was in love at the time that he created this piece. However, he actually created the Je t'aime paintings while he was going through a divorce with his second wife.[2] So instead of creating the paintings because he was in love, he created the paintings because he had “a need for love.""[3] H. H. Arnason goes on to say that, “Motherwell is unquestionably a romantic whose works are an intense if generalized reflection of his day-to-day life, his innermost emotions, his passionate involvement with art and the world in which he lives.”[3] Along with his longing for love, Motherwell also has a specific technique that he used in Je t'aime. He would first trace what he wanted to draw, make changes and then paint it.[3] This is a technique that Motherwell used in most of his paintings, and if looked at closely the viewer can see the tracing marks behind the paint. Also most of Motherwell’s paintings are considered collages. Arnason states that “these paintings retain definite aspects of the geometric cut-out shapes of the collages.”[3] This technique can also be seen in his other work. Even though Motherwell used the same technique in his paintings, the one major difference between this work and all his other paintings is color. In his work before and after the Je t'aime series, Motherwell would mainly use either or black and white. For example, before the Je t'aime series he created Elegy to the Spanish Republic XXXIV in 1953-1954: although this painting does have a background showing a little bit of color, he covered the entire background with black shaped bars and ovals, making the color very minimal. In addition to his work before the Je t'aime series, his paintings after this series goes back to mainly using black as the color in his painting. An example would be his painting Totemic Figure, which was created in 1958-1960. This painting shows Motherwell’s use of brushwork to create a black form on the canvas. But instead of using black to cover the background, in Je t'aime No. IV he uses multiple colors that overlap on one another. Arnason expounds on this difference by stating that “the important difference lies in the sheer, expressionist exuberance of the calligraphy and in the degree to which the surface, with all its brilliant color variations, is unified by the sensuous impasto of the brushwork.”[3] Along with his different use of color in his paintings, there is also a progression of Motherwell’s artistic style, which can be seen through his Je t'aime series. In Je t'aime No. II, he mainly uses warm colors, few forms and harsh brushwork to express his longing for love. In Je t'aime No. IV he starts to include more overlapping forms and cool colors. Finally in Je t'aime No. VIII Motherwell uses barely any forms, and the entire painting is mostly one color."

Traders of this type, while not of such prominence as the larger merchants of the capital, came in closer contact with ordinary English people and may have helped to allay some of the prejudice which had been manifested so strongly in 1753."

Its retrospective mood draws on a particularly 18th century emotional sensibility also found in Edward Jerningham's description of the ruins, with their natural adornments of moss and 'flow'rets', and reflected in J.

Lloviu virus,"['(Top)', 'Use of term', 'Species inclusion criteria', 'History', 'Virology\nToggle Virology subsection\nGenome\nReplication', 'Genome', 'Replication', 'References', 'External links']","The LLOV life cycle is hypothesized to begin with virion attachment to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by internalization, fusion of the virion envelope with endosomal membranes and the concomitant release of the virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. LLOV glycoprotein (GP) is cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsins) and the cleaved glycoprotein interacts with the intracellular entry receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1).[10] The virus RdRp would partially uncoat the nucleocapsid and transcribe the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which would then be translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. LLOV L would bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription would either terminate after a gene or continue to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome would be transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end would be least likely to be transcribed. The gene order would therefore be a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced would be the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell would determine when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication would result in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that would in turn be transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes would self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions would bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles would then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.[9]"

Loss (Ctrl+Alt+Del),"['(Top)', 'Background', 'Reception', 'Legacy as an Internet meme', 'References', 'External links']","On June 2, 2018, the tenth anniversary of ""Loss"", the original strip was replaced by an edit of the comic titled ""Found"".[10] While almost all of the comic remained the same, in the last panel Ethan instead looks at the audience with a smirk on his face. A day later, the original strip was restored with no explanation for the replacement.[9] Julia Alexander from Polygon considered ""Found"" to be an acknowledgement of the status ""Loss"" had achieved as a meme, comparing the evolution of the strip to Pepe the Frog.[11] Similarly, on June 2, 2019, the strip was replaced by an edit of the comic titled ""Cross"". This edit replaced the last panel with one where the birth was successful; however, the child's face is a minimalist version of the comic itself.[12]"
